Parts Models

This repository contais all the models for the parts used on the project and construction of Bancada Mitica.

All the parts contained here were designed using Solidworks 2016, and so the models are on .SLDPRT extension.
The models used for 3D printed parts are also exported on STL, so anyone can print.
I'm also going to export the .STEP files in the future, so anyone can edit the parts with other softwares, like Fusion360 or Inventor.
